# Password Validation

## Overview and motivation
Currently, `ms-users` service allows any passwords in the user registration request. But this brings some user-side security vulnerabilities.

General policies describe that password should:
 - Minimum length starts from 8 chars
 - Contain different character cases
 - Contain some digits
 - Shouldn't have many repeating characters
 - Shouldn't be in common passwords list

Additional password validation should be added to provide better security for users.

## General
A possible solution is to use existing password-strength checking solution like `dropbox/zxcvbn` - provides password strength check using predefined dictionaries and pattern matching. With password ~25 char length, projected latency is ~5-25ms. In the future, we can extend included dictionaries according to our needs.

## Note
Enabling password validator is Breaking change and disabled by default.
In the nearest future, when everything will be ready, a validator must be enabled.

## Validator Keyword
Service validation algorithm based on the AJV validator and all validation requirements are inside schemas. All incoming requests checked. We can add additional custom validator `password` keyword for the `password` field, which performs required checks. 

Current schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "register",
  "type": "object",
    "password": {
      "type": "string"
    }
}
```

After keyword added:
```json
{
  "$id": "register",
  "type": "object",
  "password": {
    "type": "string",
    "password": true
   }
}
```

## `password`
The parameter accepts the required strength in the range [0-4] that describes the required password complexity.

According to the registration process, some passwords generated by service, so custom validator should omit password check if `skipPassword` request param provided.

When executed: 
- checks username does not match provided password
- calls `zxcvbn` to obtain a complexity of passwords and returns whether the given password matches policy

Also, we can pass user-provided data into `zxcvbn` to check whether some sensitive data used in the password.
### Sample config
`forceCheckFieldName` and `inputFieldNames` values point to parent object field
`enabled` - disable/enable validator. Default value is false.
```js
const config = {
  enabled: false,
  minStrength: 3, // Desired strength
  forceCheckFieldName: 'checkPassword', // force enable password to check if the object field value set..
  inputFieldNames: [ // Linked fields list, allow filter case sensitive data in the password from the parent object.
    'username', 
    'otherfield'
  ]
}
```
